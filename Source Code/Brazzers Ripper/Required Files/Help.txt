Because this application is a sample application, it is already hardcoded to download the brazzers website.

To start the ripping operation, simply click on the Begin button. Once the operation is running, you can cancel it by simply clicking on the cancel button.

The label marked '_' allows you to minimize the application once a rip is in progress while the label marked 'V' opens up a new dialog that lists all of the already downloaded folders.

The Overwrite Existing Files option controls whether the application downloads every single parsed file or simply ignores existing files.

The about and help menu items brings up the about and help dialog screens respectively. The AutoUpdate option checks for any updates for this application.

Note: The ripped site is created in the Rip folder, located in the main application folder.
